# Chapter 2: Data Visualization

## The plot command

The plot() command is quite powerful and you can almost plot anything with it.
The trick is plotting what you want to see.
Let us load some data and get started.

```{r}
# Load tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Load ESS data

ess_data <- read.csv("data/ESS11.csv")


# Select some variables of the dataframe and pass them through plot()

plot(ess_data[1:1000,c("agea", "polintr", "lrscale", "eisced")])

# We get a bunch of scatter plots but they are not meaningful

```

Okay then, let us start with the basics!
The plot command creates an empty canvas that you can start adding points, lines,
polygons, etc.
Each plot() commands produces one figure.
When you call the plot() command again then your old figure will be overwritten 
by the new plot, i.e., you should have one plot() command per chunk, unless you 
save your figure, for example as a PNG, and not just display it.

```{r}
# a very basic plot

plot(x = c(1,2,3,4),
     y = c(2,4,6,8)
)

# Create a scatter plot

```

```{r}
# the default is a point plot but you plot a line by declaring the type argument

plot(x = c(1,2,3,4),
     y = c(2,4,6,8),
     type = "l"
)

# type = "l" means line (it is a small L not a 1!!)
# alternatively you can declare type = "p" for points and "s" for step

# try it out!




```

```{r}
# you can adjust your line 
plot(x = c(1,2,3,4),
     y = c(2,4,6,8),
     type = "l",
     lwd = 2,     #line width
     lty = 3,     #line type (solid, dashed, dotted..etc)
     col = "blue" #line color, if color is recognized code color changes
)

```

```{r}
# Add titles for the axes and the plot
plot(c(1,2,3,4),  #the first two arguments are your x and y
     c(2,4,6,8),  #so you dont need to write x = and y =
     type = "l",
     lwd = 2,     
     lty = 3,     
     col = "blue",  #transparent: col = adjustcolor("blue",alpha.f=0.5)
     main = "An Example plot",
     xlab = "dummy x",
     ylab = "dummy y"
)

```

```{r}
# notice how the plot does not start exactly at x = 1 and y = 2?
# we can change that, also let us change the size of the text (font size)

plot(c(1,2,3,4),
     c(2,4,6,8),
     type = "l",
     lwd = 2,     
     lty = 3,     
     col = "blue",
     main = "An Example plot",
     xlab = "dummy x",
     ylab = "dummy y",
     yaxs="i",         #removes empty space at start of y-axis
     xaxs="i",         #removes empty space at start of x-axis
     cex.axis = 0.8,    #changes size of axis labels
     cex.lab =  1.2,    #changes size of axis titles
     cex.main = 1.4     #changes size of plot titles
)

```

```{r}
# Let us change it back to a point plot and change the shape of the point
plot(c(1,2,3,4),
     c(2,4,6,8),
     type = "p",
     pch = 17,       #instead of line type, we choose point character   
     col = "blue",
     main = "An Example plot",
     xlab = "dummy x",
     ylab = "dummy y",
     yaxs="i",         
     xaxs="i",         
     cex.axis = 0.8,    
     cex.lab =  1.2,    
     cex.main = 1.4     
)

```

```{r}
# oh no some of our points are not showing
# Let us change our minimum and maximum values of our axes

# Let us change it back to a point plot and change the shape of the point

plot(c(1,2,3,4),
     c(2,4,6,8),
     xlim = c(0,5),
     ylim = c(0,10),
     type = "p",
     pch = 17,       #instead of line type, we choose point character   
     col = "blue",
     main = "An Example plot",
     xlab = "dummy x",
     ylab = "dummy y",
     yaxs="i",         
     xaxs="i",         
     cex.axis = 0.8,    
     cex.lab =  1.2,    
     cex.main = 1.4     
)
```

Enjoying the show?
Well, watch time is over because it is time to plot yourself!

### Applying the plot command

```{r}
#prepare the data

df_raw <- na.omit(data.frame(  
 education = ifelse(ess_data$eisced > 7, NA, ess_data$eisced),
  left_right = ifelse(ess_data$lrscale > 10, NA, ess_data$lrscale),
 soc_trust =  ifelse(ess_data$ppltrst > 10, NA, ess_data$ppltrst)))


df<- group_by(df_raw, education) %>% 
  summarise(mean_lr = mean(left_right), mean_trust = mean(soc_trust))

print(df)

```

Now, you have a dataframe with the mean political ideology (higher means more conservative) and mean social trust (higher means more trust) for each education level (higher means more educated).
Plot the relationship between education and political ideology, then between education and social trust.
Try to change the line width, type, and color between the two plots.
Add adequate labels.

```{r plot education and ideology}










```

```{r plot education and social trust}












```

### Lines

Notice that both political ideology and social trust are scaled from 0-10. 
Maybe we can have both on the same plot?

```{r}

#to set xlim and ylim, find the max and min values in your data
#range(df$education)
#range(df$mean_lr)
#range(df$mean_trust)

#after lesson four you will do it this way apply(df, 2, range)

plot(df$education,
    df$mean_lr,
    xlim = c(1,7),
    ylim = c(4,6),
     type = "l",
     lwd = 2,     
     col = "blue",
     main = expression("The Relatiohsip Between Education \n Political Ideology and Social Trust"),
     xlab = "Education Level",
     ylab = "Political Ideology/Social Trust",
     yaxs="i",         
     xaxs="i",         
     cex.main = 1.2
)


lines(
      df$education,
      df$mean_trust,
      lwd = 2,
      col = "red"
      )

```

### Points

So once we have the plot() command open, we can add more times to the same plot.
We can add points too!

```{r}

# Let us say we went out and asked our friends about their education, trust and ideology, and see how they compare to the mean of the dataset

df$edu_friends <- c(4,2,5,1,3,7,6)
df$lr_friends <-  c(5.0, 5.3, 5.1, 5.3, 5.3, 4.8, 4.9)
df$tr_friends <-  c(4.9, 4.6, 5.4, 4.6, 5.0, 6.0, 5.7)


plot(df$education,
    df$mean_lr,
    xlim = c(1,7),  
    ylim = c(4,6), 
     type = "l",
     lwd = 2,     
     col = "blue",
     main = "The Relatiohsip Between Education, \n Political Ideology and Social Trust",
     xlab = "Education Level",
     ylab = "Political Ideology/Social Trust",
     cex.main = 1.2
)


lines(
      df$education,
      df$mean_trust,
      lwd = 2,
      col = "red"
      )

#say hi to the points() command
points(
       df$edu_friends,
       df$lr_friends,
       pch = 16,       #filled circle
       col = "blue",
       cex = 1.5        #point size
)


#yup we can do it many times
points(
       df$edu_friends,
       df$tr_friends,
       pch = 15,       #filled square
       col = "red",
       cex = 1.5        #point size
)


```

### Legends

```{r}
# The reader has no idea what the colors and points mean, so let us add a legend!
plot(df$education,
    df$mean_lr,
    xlim = c(1,7),  
    ylim = c(4,6), 
     type = "l",
     lwd = 2,     
     col = "blue",
     main = "The Relatiohsip Between Education, \n Political Ideology and Social Trust",
     xlab = "Education Level",
     ylab = "Political Ideology/Social Trust",
     cex.main = 1.2
)

grid() # add a grid
box()  # box because the grid is plotted on top of the plot border


lines(
      df$education,
      df$mean_trust,
      lwd = 2,
      col = "red"
      )

# say hi to the points() command
points(
       df$edu_friends,
       df$lr_friends,
       pch = 16,       #filled circle
       col = "blue",
       cex = 1.5        #point size
)


# we can do it many times
points(
       df$edu_friends,
       df$tr_friends,
       pch = 15,       #filled square
       col = "red",
       cex = 1.5        #point size
)

legend("bottomright",   #you can give x and y or location text
       legend = c("Mean ESS Left-Right", 
                  "Mean ESS Social Trust", 
                  "Friends Left-Right",
                  "Friends Social Trust"),   #the text to be displayed
       lwd = c(2, 2,
               NA, NA),       #the two lines have lwd 2, points have NA
       col = c("blue", "red",
               "blue", "red"),
       pch = c(NA,NA,
               16,15), #lines have NA pch, then pch for points
       cex = 0.8           #size of legend
       )

# Other legend locations are "top", "bottom", "topleft", "topright", etc.
# find more legend options using ?legend


```

### Make a plot

Your turn: Let us apply what we just learned. Make a plot with a legend.
We want to plot the differences between men and women in the confidence of 
individuals in their ability to participate in politics (cptppola).

Here is the relevant documentation from the codebook of:

**cptppola** - Confident in own ability to participate in politics
*Question: And how confident are you in your own ability to participate in politics?*

| Value | Category             |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| 1     | Not at all confident |
| 2 	  | A little confident   |
| 3 	  | Quite confident      |
| 4 	  | Very confident       |
| 5 	  | Completely confident |
| 7 	  | Refusal*             |
| 8 	  | Don't know*          |
| 9 	  | No answer*           |

*) Missing Value

First, we have to recode missing values to avoid errors in calculating mean scores.

```{r}

# Recode missing values (7, 8, 9)
df2_raw <- na.omit(data.frame(  
  female = ifelse(ess_data$gndr > 1, 1, 0),
  efficacy = ifelse(ess_data$cptppola > 5, NA, ess_data$cptppola)))

# Calculate means by gender
df2 <- group_by(df2_raw, female) %>% 
  summarise(mean_efficacy = mean(efficacy), se_efficacy = sd(efficacy)/sqrt(n()))

print(df2)


```

Now you have the mean level of confidence to participate in politics broken down
by gender. Plot the mean level of support (point plot) then after successfully 
finishing the plot, add lines to the plot for the standard error.
Do not forget to add labels and a legend!

Hint: To plot the standard error, draw a line connecting the following two points:

$mean + SE$ and $mean - SE$.

```{r}







```

That one was not easy, let us see it in a basic form and then make it more advanced!

```{r}
plot(df2$female,
     df2$mean_efficacy,
     xlim = c(-0.5,1.5),  
     ylim = c(2,2.4), 
     type = "p",
     pch = 16,     
     col = "black",
     main = "The Relatiohsip between Gender and confidence in participating in politics",
     xlab = "Respondent is Female",
     ylab = "Confidence in own ability to participate in politics",
     yaxs="i",         
     xaxs="i",
     cex.main =  0.95
)


lines(
      c(df2[1,1],df2[1,1]),
      c(df2[1,2]-df2[1,3],df2[1,2]+df2[1,3]),
      lwd = 2,
      col = "black"
      )

lines(
      c(df2[2,1],df2[2,1]),
      c(df2[2,2]-df2[2,3],df2[2,2]+df2[2,3]),
      lwd = 2,
      col = "black"
      )


legend("bottomleft",   
       legend = c("Mean Value",  "Standard Error"),   
       col = "black",
       pch = c(16,NA),
       lty = c(NA, 1),
       cex = 0.8          
       )

abline(v = 0.5) # vertical line at x = 0.5


```

Something about the x-axis does not look right, well... 
Let us push it to the next level!

```{r}
plot(df2$female,
    df2$mean_efficacy,
    xaxt = "n",          # remove the x-axis so we can create it our way
    xlim = c(-0.5,1.5),  
    ylim = c(2,2.4), 
     type = "p",
     pch = 16,     
     col = "black",
     main = "The Relatiohsip Between Gender and Supporting Fairness of Courts",
    xlab = "",          # we don't need that anymore, you will see
     ylab = "Support for Fairness of Courts",  
      yaxs="i",         
      xaxs="i",
    cex.main =  0.95
)

axis(
      1,            #x-axis, 2 is y-axis
      at = c(0,1),  # where the labels will be placed
      tick = F,     #remove tick marks
      labels = c("Male", "Female")
      )


lines(
      c(df2[1,1],df2[1,1]),
      c(df2[1,2]-df2[1,3],df2[1,2]+df2[1,3]),
      lwd = 2,
      col = "black"
      )

lines(
      c(df2[2,1],df2[2,1]),
      c(df2[2,2]-df2[2,3],df2[2,2]+df2[2,3]),
      lwd = 2,
      col = "black"
      )


legend("bottomleft",   
       legend = c("Mean Value",  "Standard Error"),   
       col = "black",
       pch = c(16,NA),
       lty = c(NA, 1),
       cex = 0.8          
       )

abline(v = 0.5) # vertical line at x = 0.5

```

As you can see, you can do almost anything with your plots.
Sometimes you just need to think linearly and type all the arguments, 
other times you need to think outside the box.

## Other plots

Now let us look at two other important types of plots: histograms and density plots!
Both are used to see the distribution of your variables. 
The mean alone or the min/max do not tell the entire story.

### Histogram

```{r}

hist(df_raw$left_right)

#we can see that our sample is pretty balanced between left and right, and many people identify right in the center

#we know we have 11 (0-10) which translates to 10 intervals, let's add that in to make the graph look better with another edits

```

```{r}

hist(df_raw$left_right,
     ylab = "",
     xlab = "Left-Right",
     main = "Histogram for Lef-Right Political Placement",
     breaks = 10,
     col = "darkgrey")


```

### Density plot

A similar plot can be obtained with plotting the density:

```{r}
plot(
     density(df_raw$left_right), # notice density() replaced both x and y
     ylab = "Density",
     xlab = "Left-Right",
     main = "Distribution of Lef-Right Political Placement",
     lwd = 2,
     )

# With the bw (bandwith), kernel or adjust arguments, you can change how and 
# how much the density is smoothed. 
# The kernel (default: gaussian) affects the choice of the smoothing algorithm.
# The bandwidth (bw) affects how much smoothing is applied.
# The adjust argument is a multiple of the default bandwidth.
plot(
     density(df_raw$left_right, 
             kernel = "rectangular", # use rectangular smoothing 
             adjust = 0.5),          # half of the default smoothing bandwidth
     ylab = "Density",
     xlab = "Left-Right",
     main = "Distribution of Lef-Right Political Placement",
     lwd = 2,
     )

```

```{r}
# Let us plot the density of something else

plot(
     density(df2_raw$female), 
     ylab = "Density",
     xlab = "Gender:Male = 0, Female = 1",
     main = "Distribution of Gender in the Sample",
     lwd = 2
     )

# In our sample, the share of females is slightly higher than the share of males

```

## Export plots

```{r}
# You can save your plot as PNG, PDF, or SVG to your computer 
# instead of just displaying it

# Save as PNG
png("density_plot_gender.png",
    width = 5, height = 6,  units = "in", # size of the plot (here in inches)
    res = 300 # resolution (dpi), 300 usually is sufficient
    )

plot(
     density(df2_raw$female), 
     ylab = "Density",
     xlab = "Gender:Male = 0, Female = 1",
     main = "Distribution of Gender in the Sample",
     lwd = 2
     )

dev.off() # tell R the plotting is over

# Save as PDF (PDF generates a vector graphic. Vector graphics are not based on 
# pixels but resizable vectors. Thus, they do not have a predefined resolution.)
pdf("density_plot_gender.pdf",
    width = 5, height = 6, # size of the plot (default: inches)
    )

plot(
     density(df2_raw$female), 
     ylab = "Density",
     xlab = "Gender:Male = 0, Female = 1",
     main = "Distribution of Gender in the Sample",
     lwd = 2
     )

dev.off() # End plotting to PDF


```

It is good practice to save your figures in a subfolder, e.g. "figures/", within
your working directory. However, keep in mind that R cannot create a folder using
the `pdf()` command. For example, if you want to create pdf in "figures/" using
`pdf("figures/plot.pdf")`, then you have to create the "figures" folder first,
else R will return an error.


## Concluding Remarks

This should give you a good introduction to plotting in R.
Once you have the base, you simply add every detail to your graphic step by step.
There are a lot more small details you can adjust in your graphics, but there are
too many to cover them all.
The idea was to introduce you to the basics to start making your own graphics,
that are presentable enough for publication.
If you want to save your plots, you can simply click the export button in the 
plot window. For a cheat sheet, click this [Link](https://publish.illinois.edu/johnrgallagher/files/2015/10/BaseGraphicsCheatsheet.pdf).

You will encounter numerous other plot types such as bar plots and box plots.
Something else that you will run into is the par() command which allows you to 
adjust the margin of your graph and display multiple figures on the same plot 
(next to each other).

#### No Exercises this time!

Instead, it would be great it if you check the file "Intro_to_R_Session_2_ggplot.Rmd"
and see how plotting is done in ggplot.
Maybe you will like the alternatives provided by the `ggplot2` package way more!

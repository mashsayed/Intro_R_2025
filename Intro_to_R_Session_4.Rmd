# Chapter 04: Loops and Functions

For our last chapter I want to introduce to a way to work more efficient.
R is a programming language for statistical analysis, but it also includes 
classical elements of programming.

Two main operations are loops and functions.
We can automate tasks and the earlier you learn about it the faster you can 
advance and understand the logic of R.

## 1. Loops

For example, you can use a loop to iterate through a list of numbers and perform
calculations on each number, or to go through the rows of a dataset and apply 
certain operations to each row. Loops provide a way to streamline your code and 
avoid writing repetitive instructions manually.

There are different type of Loops, but for this course we focus just on the 
`for` loops, since you will see them also in the QM Tutorial.

### 1.2 `For` loops

Do you remember my grade example from the first chapter?

```{r}
# input a grade

#inputting a grade

grade <- 1.7

if (grade == 1.0) {
  print("Perfect") 
} else if ( grade <= 2.0) {
  print("Amazing")
} else if (grade <= 3.0) {
  print("Good Job")
} else {
  print("Life goes on") 
}

grade <- 3.3

if (grade == 1.0) {
  print("Perfect") 
} else if ( grade <= 2.0) {
  print("Amazing")
} else if (grade <= 3.0) {
  print("Good Job")
} else {
  print("Life goes on") 
}


grade <- 1.0

if (grade == 1.0) {
  print("Perfect") 
} else if ( grade <= 2.0) {
  print("Amazing")
} else if (grade <= 3.0) {
  print("Good Job")
} else {
  print("Life goes on") 
}


grade <- 2.3

if (grade == 1.0) {
  print("Perfect") 
} else if ( grade <= 2.0) {
  print("Amazing")
} else if (grade <= 3.0) {
  print("Good Job")
} else {
  print("Life goes on") 
}


grade <- 1.7

if (grade == 1.0) {
  print("Perfect") 
} else if ( grade <= 2.0) {
  print("Amazing")
} else if (grade <= 3.0) {
  print("Good Job")
} else {
  print("Life goes on") 
}


```

I could now write down all my grades and assign them as I did in the first chapter, 
but there is a way to automatize this process.
For that I will use the `For` loop.

First, let us make a vector with grades:

```{r}

grades <- c(1.7, 3.3, 2.3, 1.0)

```

Now, we can directly dive into the loop.

-   Write down `for` and in brackets you define the **loop iterator**, this is 
    the **i** in the loop.
    
-   Then you define in which object of interest you want to iterate.
    In our case, the operation should be iterated in the grades vector.
    I could also write down the number 5, but it is convention to define an object.
    Why?

-   After closing the brackets you open fancy brackets and write down your 
    function,as you would normally, but this time you need to define how the 
    iterator is used. Since I use the numbers in grades, my iterator needs to be
    put in brackets, after the name of the grades.
    Why?

-   And that is it basically

```{r}

#grades <- c(1.7, 3.3, 2.3, 1.0)

for (i in 1:length(grades)) {
if (grades[i] == 1.0) {
  print("Perfect") 
} else if ( grades[i] <= 2.0) {
  print("Amazing")
} else if (grades[i] <= 3.0) {
  print("Good Job")
} else {
  print("Life goes on") 
}
}

```

Loops can work differently:

In this example I have a number vector and my let the console print a sentence, 
where I vary the number and therefore the sentence changes over every loop

```{r}

num <- c(3, 43, 113, 143, 171, 249)

for (i in num) { 
  print(paste0("This is the ", i, "th Iteration")) 
}

#paste0 is equivalent to : paste(, sep = "")

```

When would you need loops? When you apply an operation to multiple columns of 
your dataset one after the other (like obtain the mean of every column), or when
adding elements to your plot as follows:

```{r}
#lets create a dataset for the relationship between age and certain characteristics

age_data <- data.frame(age = c(15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65),
                       education = c(0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.81, 0.82, 0.83),
                       income = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.85, 0.4),
                       conservatism = c(0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.65),
                       likely_vote = c(0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.65, 0.7, 0.8))

line_col <- c("black", "black", "darkgrey", "darkgrey")
line_lty <- c(1,2,1,2)


plot (age_data$age, 
      age_data$education, 
      type = "l",
      xlim = c(15,65),
      ylim =  c(0,1),
      xlab = "Age [years]",
      ylab = "Characteristic [scale 0-1]",
      yaxs="i",
      xaxs="i",
      main = "",
      col = line_col[1],
      lwd = 2,
      lty = line_lty[1])

for(i in 3:ncol(age_data)){
  lines(age_data$age, 
        age_data[[i]],
        lwd = 2, 
        col = line_col[i-1], 
        lty = line_lty[i-1])
}

legend("bottomright", 
       legend = c("Education", "Income", 
                  "Conservatism", "Likelihood Vote"), 
       lwd = 2, 
       col = line_col,
       lty = line_lty,
       pch = NA,
       cex = 0.85,
       inset = c(0.01,0.02)
       )




```


### 1.2 Nested Loops

Since you will eventually encounter them, I will show you shortly nested loops, 
although they are not super common (because most R functions are vectorized):

First, let us play a game of tic tac toe:

```{r}

#Defining a matrix 
ttt <- matrix(c("X", "O", "X",
                "O", "X", "O",
                "O", "X", "O"), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

```

We define a loop with an iterator **i** for the rows of the matrix, and we 
define another one for the columns with the iterator **j**.

Afterwords, we built up the body, in which aim to get information about the matrix
and its content. The sentence shows, which rows and columns contain which values.

```{r}

for (i in 1:nrow(ttt)) {
  for (j in 1:ncol(ttt)) {
    print(paste("On row", i, "and column", j, "the board contains", ttt[i,j]))
  }
}

```

## 2. `apply()` Function Family

### 2.1 `apply()`

The `apply()` function in R is primarily used to avoid explicit uses of loop constructs.
The idea is to apply a function repeatedly to a matrix or data frame: apply(X, MARGIN, FUNCTION)

```{r}

#Let us create a matrix with random numbers 

mat <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 6)

head(mat) # It just counts to 10

```

Assume you now want to calculate the mean of every column:

```{r}

apply(mat, 2, mean) 
# 1) You include the object, 2) the margin: there is a deeper meaning of what the margin means but for almost all uses (especially while working with 2-D data) , margin = 1 means you apply the function to your rows and margin = 2 means apply the functions to your columns, 3) and lastly the function

apply(mat, 2, sum) #Let us get the sum of the columns
apply(mat, 2, sd) #The standard deviation


#The corresponding Loop would look like this: 

for (i in 1:ncol(mat)) {
  mean_col <- mean(mat[, i])
  print(mean_col)
}

apply(mat, 1, sum) #summing the rows

#you can add arguments to the function
#let's at a missing value to our matrix

mat[1,1] <- NA

apply(mat, 2, sum) #see the difference with NA?

apply(mat, 2, sum, na.rm = T) #now we disregarded the NA 



```

The `apply()` function is useful especially if you are working with dimensional 
data structures and want to calculate anything. However, they can not keep up 
with the flexibility of loops, you should be aware of that.

### Notes

Loops and the apply function are widely used in programming. However, This is 
just an introductory course, so now you have an idea what is happening, if you 
are seeing those two things in the scripts. But if you are interested in this 
topic, please read into `while` loops and `repeat` loops. The `apply()` function
is part of a family: `sapply()`, `lapply()`, `tapply()` are also in that family.

## 3. Writing your own functions

We can again safe a lot of time and be more efficient by writing our own function.

-   First, you need to define a name for your function#
-   Afterwards, you write down the command with the `function()` command. Put your 
    variables into the parentheses. Later your input follows those variables.
-   After the fancy brackets, you define your operation with your predefined variables.
-   Lastly, you want the function to return your quantity of interest and close 
    the fancy brackets
-   Afterwards you have a function saved and can operate with it

```{r}

#My function is just a sum

add <- function(x, y) { 
  
  result <- x + y
  return(result)
}

add(2,7) #Now I can use my function

```

Let us calculate the area of a circle

```{r}

aoc <- function(radius) {
  pi <- 3.14159
  
  area <- pi * radius^2
  
  return(area)
}

aoc(5)

```

Let us combine what we have learned in this chapter with the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonnaci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the 
sum of the two numbers before it.
The Fibonacci sequence continues indefinitely, producing a sequence like this: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

```{r}


fibonacci <- function(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    stop("Invalid input. Please provide a positive integer.") 
  } else if (n == 1) {
    sequence <- 0
  } else if (n == 2) {
    sequence <- c(0, 1)
  } else {
    sequence <- numeric(n)
    sequence[1] <- 0
    sequence[2] <- 1
    for (i in 3:n) {
      sequence[i] <- sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]
    }
  }
  return(sequence)
}

fibonacci(10)

```

## Exercise Section

### Exercise 1:

Write a `for` loop that prints the square of each number from 1 to 10

```{r}

#Assigning an object for a better workflow
number <- 10

#The Loop 




```

### Exercise 2:

Do the same, but this time defining a function that squares numbers.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#Defining a function for squaring

sq <- function (x) {
  
  
  
}

#Defining a vector containing a vector from 1 to 10 
numbers <- c(1:10) 

#Applying the number 
sq(numbers)

```

### Exercise 3:

This is the midnight formula separated in two equations:

\$\$

x\_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

\$\$

Make **one function** for the midnight formula, so the output are both.
Test it with a = 2, b = -6, c = -8

**Hint**: You need two split up the formula into two equations with two outputs.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

mnf <- 


mnf(2, -6, -8)

```

### Exercise 4: Zodiac Fortune Teller

In the last exercise of this course, we will learn about our future based on our 
Zodiac Sign. For this we well need a `function`, a `loop` and an `ifelse` 
condition or function.

a.  First we define a function called `zodiacFortuneTeller()`.
    This function takes only your sign as input

b.  Afterwards we need to define our fortunes for each zodiac with a vector

c.  Then we need to define a vector with contains the zodiac signs

d.  Lastly we need a `for` loop, which returns the respective fortune for each 
    zodiac sign.

e.  This fortune should be returned

```{r, eval = FALSE}

fortune <- function(sign) {
  
  #Fortunes vector 
  fortunes <- c("Exciting opportunities are on the horizon for you!",
              "Your creative talents will shine brightly this month!",
              "Financial abundance is heading your way!",
              "You will experience a period of personal growth and
              self-discovery!",
              "New friendships will bring joy and fulfillment into you
              life!",
              "Your hard work and dedication will pay off in unexpected
              ways!",
              "Travel plans will bring you exciting adventures and memorable
              experiences!",
              "A long-awaited dream will finally become a reality!",
              "Your positive attitude and optimism will attract great
              success!",
              "Love and romance will blossom in your life!",
              "Embrace change and seize new opportunities with confidence!",
              "Your intuitive insights will guide you to make wise
              decisions!",
              "A new career opportunity will open doors to success and
              fulfillment!",
              "You have the power to overcome any challenges that come your
              way!",
              "Your generosity and kindness will be rewarded abundantly!",
              "Self-care and self-love will lead to inner peace and harmony!"
              )
  
  #Zodiac_sings vector 
  
  zodiac_signs <- 
  
  #For loop 

  
  
}

```

## Last Notes

See this course as a starting point.
Do not be frustrated if you did not get everything at the first time.
Learning R is a process and you need to be open to it.
To further develop your R Skills, check out the two courses from Okan and Lion 
that we mentioned at the beginning and the course. 

Also here are some additional resources:

-   [R Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/): Especially in the beginning, it is hard to know important codes by heart.
    For this case the R cheat sheets for some important packages are helpful.
    I recommend to print or save digitally the cheat sheets for dplyr, ggplot2, and [base R](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf).

-   [Hertie School Data Science Summer School 2021/22/23](https://www.youtube.com/@datasciencelab.berlin/playlists): 
Amazing tutorials in English from a top German University. The tutorials cover 
topics from introduction to R, visualizing data in R, to more advanced topics 
like webscraping with R. You can work on many skills and application of R once 
you are comfortable with the basics. You can freely watch the full tutorials on 
Youtube but also access the course materials [here](https://ds3.ai/summerschool),

    A complete R course, very detailed is this from Jenny Bryan.

-   [Introduction to Econometrics in R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html).
    You will take the QM course, but this book is helpful, when it comes to data
    analysis in R. Maybe it helps as a cheat sheet for QM.
